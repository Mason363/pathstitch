Pathstitch is for makers who want **CAD precision without CAD overhead**. Sketch a pattern with snapping and
live dimensions, round corners parametrically, drop in saddle‑stitch holes and glue tabs, then export
cut‑ready DXF/SVG/PDF — or import a 3D `.step` model and **unfold it into flat panels** you can actually cut
and sew. It's a fast, native SwiftUI app backed by a real geometry kernel (`ezdxf`, `shapely`, OpenCASCADE),
not a web wrapper.

## Download

**[⬇ Download the latest release](https://github.com/Mason363/pathstitch/releases/latest)** — grab
`Pathstitch-x.y.z.dmg`, drag it into Applications, and you're running. No Python, no setup; the geometry
engine ships inside the app.

- **Requires:** an Apple‑Silicon Mac (M1 or newer) on **macOS 14 (Sonoma)+**.
- The app is **ad‑hoc signed, not Apple‑notarized**, so the first launch needs a one‑time Gatekeeper
  approval — see **[Installing](#installing-the-app)**.

## What it does

### Draw
Line, circle, rectangle, text, and an Illustrator‑style **pen** tool, all with point/edge **snapping** and
**on‑creation dimensions** — type a width, `Tab`, type a height, `Enter`, done.

> ### 🟥 [IMAGE: Drawing a rectangle — the dimension input boxes (e.g. “80.00 mm” / “40.00 mm”) shown live on the canvas]

### Edit
- **Parametric fillet & chamfer** (G1/G2). Every corner is independent, draggable to size, and stays
  editable forever — it can even grow until adjacent fillets meet. Works on polylines, the corner where two
  separate lines meet, and imported geometry.
- **Trim**, Fusion‑style: hover a segment to see exactly what will be removed, then click — or drag across
  several — to cut at every intersection.
- Move/rotate gizmo, point‑to‑point move, scale, mirror, reflect, duplicate.

> ### 🟥 [IMAGE: Fillet in action — a rectangle with one corner mid‑drag showing the radius arrow and a large rounded corner, the others still sharp]

> ### 🟥 [IMAGE: Trim hover preview — a line crossing a shape with the to‑be‑removed segment highlighted in red]

### Make
- **Stitch holes & saddle‑stitch patterns** generated along any path, with spacing and corner controls.
- **Offset**, **convert‑lines** (dashed/perforated styles), **patterning**, and **paper folding**
  (crease lines + glue tabs) for assembling 3D objects from flat stock.

> ### 🟥 [IMAGE: Stitch‑hole generation — evenly spaced holes following the outline of a leather piece]

### Go 3D → 2D
Import `.step` / `.stp`, inspect it in a Three.js viewport, and **unfold developable surfaces into flat
nets** ready for the 2D tools.

> ### 🟥 [IMAGE: Split view — a 3D STEP model on the left, its unfolded 2D net with fold lines on the right]

### Export & integrate
DXF, SVG, PDF, and PNG export; native `.stch` project files; and **Finder QuickLook previews + thumbnails**
for DXF and STEP. Plus the niceties: customizable keybinds, light/dark themes, a `⌘K` command palette, and a
rearrangeable toolbar.

## Under the hood

Pathstitch is a thin, fast SwiftUI front‑end over a persistent Python geometry worker. The UI never blocks on
geometry: every operation is a JSON request streamed to a long‑lived backend process and rendered back.

```
┌──────────────────────────────┐        JSON over stdin/stdout        ┌────────────────────────────┐
│  SwiftUI front-end (macOS)    │  ─────────────────────────────────▶ │  Python engine             │
│  AppState · DxfCanvasView ·   │   PythonBridge ↔ pathstitch_core    │  ezdxf · shapely · numpy   │
│  ThreeDViewport (WKWebView)   │  ◀───────────────────────────────── │  pythonOCC (STEP) ·        │
└──────────────────────────────┘                                      │  matplotlib (PDF/PNG)      │
                                                                       └────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Front‑end** — Swift / SwiftUI (`Pathstitch/Pathstitch`). `PythonBridge.swift` keeps one
  `python -m pathstitch_core.worker` process alive and streams framed JSON to it.
- **Engine** — `pathstitch_core/`: `dxf_ops.py` (2D), `step_ops.py` / `surface_unfold.py` /
  `net_unfold.py` (3D & unfolding), driven by `worker.py`.
- **3D viewport** — `viewport3d.html` (Three.js) inside a `WKWebView`.

For a packaged build, a trimmed copy of the Python environment and the engine are bundled into
`Pathstitch.app/Contents/Resources/`, so the shipped app has no external dependencies.

## Build from source

You only need this if you want to develop Pathstitch; end users just download the `.dmg`.

**Requirements**

| Component | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **macOS** | **14.0 (Sonoma)+** | Developed/tested on macOS 26. |
| **Xcode** | **16+** | Built with Xcode 26.5 / Swift 6.3. |
| **Python** | **3.11** | The geometry backend. |

**Python packages** (`pathstitch_core/requirements.txt` + 3D/raster extras):

```
ezdxf          # DXF read/write + 2D geometry
shapely        # offsets, booleans, polygon ops
numpy          # math
svgwrite       # SVG export
matplotlib     # PDF / PNG raster export
pythonocc-core # STEP import + 3D (OpenCASCADE) — install via conda-forge, not pip
```

**Steps**

```bash
# 1. clone
git clone https://github.com/Mason363/pathstitch.git
cd pathstitch

# 2. backend env (conda recommended for pythonocc-core)
conda create -n pathstitch python=3.11
conda activate pathstitch
conda install -c conda-forge pythonocc-core
pip install -r pathstitch_core/requirements.txt matplotlib

# 3. sanity check the engine
PYTHONPATH=. python pathstitch_core/test_dxf_ops.py   # → "ALL TESTS PASSED SUCCESSFULLY!"
```

When run **from Xcode**, the app falls back to your local interpreter + repo. Set the two fallback paths
once near the top of
[`Pathstitch/Pathstitch/Bridge/PythonBridge.swift`](Pathstitch/Pathstitch/Bridge/PythonBridge.swift):

```swift
"/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/envs/pathstitch/bin/python"  // your env (echo $CONDA_PREFIX/bin/python)
"/absolute/path/to/this/repo"                                       // this checkout
```

Then open `Pathstitch/Pathstitch.xcodeproj` and ⌘R (or `xcodebuild ... -configuration Debug build`).

---

## Packaging a distributable `.dmg`

One command produces a self‑contained, drag‑to‑install image:

```bash
bash scripts/package_app.sh
# → dist/Pathstitch-1.0.dmg   (~400 MB, self-contained, ad-hoc signed)
```

It builds the Release app, copies a **trimmed** Python env (≈2.8 GB → ≈1.1 GB — OpenCASCADE stays; dev‑only
LLVM/Qt/VTK/headers are dropped) plus `pathstitch_core` into the bundle, ad‑hoc signs it, and creates a
`.dmg` whose window has the app next to an **Applications** shortcut (drag one onto the other). Point it at a
different env with `CONDA_ENV=/path/to/env bash scripts/package_app.sh`.

> The bundled env is **arm64**, so the image targets Apple‑Silicon Macs. For a no‑warning install you'd need a
> paid **Apple Developer ID** signature + notarization (`xcrun notarytool`); without it, users do the
> one‑time bypass below.

---

## Installing the app

Because Pathstitch isn't Apple‑notarized, Gatekeeper warns on first launch. Do this **once**:

1. Open the `.dmg`, drag **Pathstitch** onto **Applications**, and double‑click it.
2. On the “…cannot be opened because Apple cannot check it…” dialog, click **Done**.
3. Go to **System Settings ▸ Privacy & Security**, scroll down, and click **Open Anyway** next to the
   Pathstitch message. Confirm with Touch ID / your password.

*(Terminal alternative, if you trust the source: `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Pathstitch.app`.)*

**Checking your macOS version:**  ▸ About This Mac, or `sw_vers -productVersion` (needs `14.0`+).

## Status & roadmap

Pathstitch is an actively developed **1.0**. The 2D pipeline (draw → edit → stitch → export) is the mature
core; 3D STEP import + unfolding works for developable surfaces and is expanding. Currently **Apple‑Silicon
only** — an Intel/universal build is possible by repackaging the backend on an Intel Mac.

Issues and ideas are welcome via the tracker.
